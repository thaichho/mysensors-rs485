# GatewaySerialRS485

## Description

This project contains the code for a Serial Gateway utilizing an RS485 interface. The code (`GateWaySerialRS485.ino`) was copied from [MySensors GitHub repository](https://github.com/mysensors/MySensors/blob/master/examples/GatewaySerialRS485/GatewaySerialRS485.ino). The Serial Gateway serves as a connection point for devices within a Wired network, allowing communication between MySensors nodes and a SmartHome hub (e.g., HomeAssistant). The hardware is typically connected directly to the SmartHome hub via USB.

## Usage

1. Upload the `GateWaySerialRS485.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the RS485 interface according to your setup and wiring requirements.
3. Configure your SmartHome hub (e.g., HomeAssistant) to recognize and communicate with the Serial Gateway.
