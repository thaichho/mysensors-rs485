# GateControlRS485

## Description

This project contains a gate control using a RS485 interface. The code (`GateControlRS485.ino`) works together with the RS485 Serial Gateway within a Wired network, allowing communication between MySensors nodes and a SmartHome hub (e.g., HomeAssistant). 
The relays can be controlled via SmartHome Hub, in my case HomeAssistent

## Usage

1. Upload the `GateWaySerialRS485.ino` sketch to your Arduino board.
2. Connect the RS485 interface according to your setup and wiring requirements.
3. Configure your SmartHome hub (e.g., HomeAssistant) to recognize and communicate with the Serial Gateway.
4. ... to be continued
